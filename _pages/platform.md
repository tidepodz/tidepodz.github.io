## Brad Whipple's Platform and Policy

I am running for Idaho Falls City Council on a platform that emphasizes 
* Small Government
* Transparency
* Fiscal Responsibility
* Preservation of Property Rights

A small government is an inexpensive government and emphasises personal responsiblity. I believe one of the driving forces behind the rising costs in our community is the excessive red tape and restrictions placed on property and business owners.

While the City Council cannot control every factor influencing costs, such as housing costs. It can play a meaningful role in reducing unnecessary bureaucratic barriers. Whenever an opportunity arises to streamline procedures and give property owners more flexibility, I will advocate for it.



#### 👮 Public Safety and Support for Law Enforcement

Keeping our community safe is one of the most important responsibilities of city government and I have great respect for the men and women who serve to keep Idaho Falls safe. Policing is an incredibly demanding and often underappreciated profession—one that is easy to critique after the fact, but very difficult in the moment. The Idaho Falls Police Department has my full support, and I am committed to ensuring our officers have the training, resources, and community backing they need to do their jobs effectively and return safely to their families at the end of every shift.

#### 💰 Fiscal Responsibility

Taxpayer dollars must be treated with care and respect. I will work to ensure city spending is transparent, efficient, and focused on core priorities such as safety, infrastructure, and essential services. By eliminating waste and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, we can keep taxes reasonable while still maintaining the services residents depend on.

#### 🔧 Infrastructure & Growth

As Idaho Falls continues to grow, it’s critical that our roads, utilities, and public spaces keep pace. I will advocate for responsible, long-term planning through reasonalbe impact fees that prevents overburdening our existing systems. Smart infrastructure investments will keep our city strong and livable for years to come.

#### 📈 Economic Development

Local businesses are the backbone of Idaho Falls, and city government should help—not hinder—their success. I support reducing red tape for small business owners, streamlining permits, and fostering an environment that attracts new employers. Economic growth should benefit everyone in our community, strengthening both our workforce and our quality of life.

#### 🔍 Transparency & Accountability

Residents deserve a city government that is open, honest, and accessible. I will advocate for clear communication from City Hall, public input on major decisions, and accountability in how policies are made and implemented. City leaders should always answer to the people they serve.

#### 👪 Quality of Life

Our city is more than streets and buildings—it’s a community where families live, work, and build their futures. I support maintaining and improving our parks, recreation opportunities, and community programs. Strong neighborhoods and vibrant public spaces are what make Idaho Falls a place we’re all proud to call home.

#### 💧 Utilities & Sustainability

Reliable and affordable utilities are essential to every household and business. I will prioritize the long-term stability of our water, sewer, and power systems while ensuring rates remain fair. I also support exploring practical, cost-effective ways to manage our natural resources responsibly so that Idaho Falls remains strong for future generations.
